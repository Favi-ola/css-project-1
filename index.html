    Research proves that when you listen to music you like, your brain releases dopamine, a “feel-good” neurotransmitter.
    Valorie Salimpoor, a neuroscientist at McGill University, injected eight music-lovers with a radioactive substance that
    binds to dopamine receptors after they listened to their favorite music. A PET scan showed that large amounts of
    dopamine were released, which biologically caused the participants to feel emotions like happiness, excitement, and joy.
    
    So the next time you need an emotional boost, listen to your favorite tunes for 15 minutes. That’s all it takes to get a
    natural high!

<p style="color: blueviolet;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-style: italic ;text-align: center;">Music Reduces Depression


More than 350 million people suffer from depression around the world. A whopping 90% of them also experience insomnia.
The sleep research above found that symptoms of depression decreased significantly in the group that listened to
classical music before bedtime, but not in the other two groups. Another study by Hans Joachim Trappe in Germany also
demonstrated that music can benefit patients with depressive symptoms, depending on the type of music. Meditative sounds
and classical music lifted people up, but techno and heavy metal brought people down even more.

The next time you feel low, put on some classical or meditative music to lift your spirits.</p>

<h2 class="myclass">Researchers discovered that music can help you learn and recall information better, but it depends on how much you like
the music and whether or not you’re a musician. Subjects memorized Japanese characters while listening to music that
either seemed positive or neutral to them. The results showed that participants who were musicians learned better with
neutral music but tested better when pleasurable music was playing. Non-musicians, on the other hand, learned better
with positive music but tested better with neutral music.

Memorize these results. You now have a strategy to study more effectively for your next test.

<h2 id="h2id">Research at Drexel University in Philadelphia found that music therapy and pre-recorded music reduced pain more than
standard treatments in cancer patients. Other research showed that music can decrease pain in intensive care patients
and geriatric care patients, but the selection needed to be either classical pieces, meditative music, or songs of the
patient’s choosing.

Bob Marely was right about this one – listen to music you love to take your pain away.</h2>
<h3>Research shows that taking music lessons predicts higher academic performance and IQ in young children. In one study,
6-year-olds who took keyboard or singing lessons in small groups for 36 weeks had significantly larger increases in IQ
and standardized educational test results than children who took either drama lessons or no lessons. The singing group
did the best.

To help your children achieve academic excellence, encourage them to sing or learn to play an instrument.
